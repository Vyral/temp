  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <p>With practice comes confidence. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them.</p>

  <p>Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. The least little bit can do so much. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends.</p>

  <p>This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. You can create anything that makes you happy. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing.</p>
