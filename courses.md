  <p>My name a Borat. I come from Kazakhstan. Can I say a first, we support your war of terror! May we show our support to our boys in Iraq! May US and A kill every single terrorist! May your George Bush drink the blood of every single man, women, and child of Iraq! May you destroy their country so that for next thousand years not even a single lizard will survive in their desert!</p>

  <p>It is three in the morning, and I am in the nest of Jews. They have cleverly shifted their shapes; one of them has taken the form of a little old woman. You can barely see her horns! She has tried to poison me already. These rats are very clever.</p>

  <p>I arrived in America's airport with clothings, US dollars, and a jar of gypsy tears to protect me from AIDS.</p>

  <p>He is my neighbor Nursultan Tuliagby. He is pain in my assholes. I get a window from a glass, he must get a window from a glass. I get a step, he must get a step. I get a clock radio, he cannot afford. Great success!</p>

  <p>I had no car, no money, and no Azamat. The only thing keeping me going was my dream of one day holding Pamela in my arms and then making romantic explosion on her stomach.</p>

  <h2><a name="3" class="course-title">Course 3</a></h2>

  <p>Wawaweewaa! Ooh lala! Oh well, King in the Castle, King in the Castle, I have a chair! Go do this, go do this, King in the Castle.</p>

  <p>This C.J. was like no Kazakh woman I have ever seen. She had golden hairs, teeth as white as pearls, and the asshole of a seven-year-old. For the first time in my lifes, I was in love.</p>
